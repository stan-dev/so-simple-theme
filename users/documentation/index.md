# Stan User's Guide

The Stan user's guide provides example models and programming
techniques for coding statistical models in Stan.
It also serves as an example-driven introduction to Bayesian modeling
and inference.
For versions 2.18 and later, this is titled _Stan User's Guide_.
For versions 2.17 and earlier, this is part of the _Stan Reference Manual_.

# Stan Language Reference Manual

The manual for Stan's programming language for coding probability models,
inference algorithms for fitting models and making predictions,
and posterior analysis tools for evaluating the results.
This manual applies to all Stan interfaces.

# Stan Language Functions Reference

The reference for the functions defined in the Stan math
library and available in the Stan programming language.
For versions 2.17 and earlier, this is part of the _Stan Reference Manual_.

# Stan Software Development Lifecycle

The software development practices underlying the code managed
by the Stan project is hosted at

* [Stan Software Development Lifecycle](/docs/sdlc.html)

# RStan Documentation

*  [RStan Vignettes, tutorials, and other package information](/rstan)

# PyStan Documentation

* [PyStan API documentation from readthedocs.org](https://pystan.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api.html)

# Case Studies and Notebooks

Case studies provide longer, more-detailed discussion of various
applications, models, and methodologies.  Each case study is written
in knitr or Jupyter notebooks so that the discussion is accompanied
with working code.  Case studies written or validated by the Stan
development team can be found at

* <p><a href="/users/documentation/case-studies.html">
  Case Studies</a></p>

The proceedings of each Stan Conference also take the form of
self-contained notebooks. StanCon notebooks are hosted on GitHub
along with other materials from the conferences:

  StanCon Materials</a> &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="note">(GitHub, with video links)</span></p>

# Tutorials

The Stan development team and many users have contributed tutorials aimed at introducing users to various aspects of statistical modeling with Stan, both
in written and visual formats.  These tutorials can be found at

* <p><a href="/users/documentation/tutorials.html">Tutorials</a></p>


# Specialized Field Guides

Tutorials, case studies, software packages, and publications related to
specific fields. These pages are maintained by volunteers from the Stan
community. If you would like to contribute one for your field please reach
out on the Stan forums.

# The Stan Forums

The most up to date discussion of modeling techniques and computational
issues if often found in the Stan Forums before it ends up in a case study
or a paper.

* <p><a href="http://discourse.mc-stan.org/">Stan Forums</a>
<span class="note">(Discourse)</span></p>

Discussions prior to June 2017 are archived and public on the now deprecated
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/stan-users">Stan Users Google Group</a>.

# GitHub Stan Developer Wiki

The Stan Wiki is largely focused on development documentation but it also
includes a few pages with helpful information for users.
