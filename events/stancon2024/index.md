Dates: September 9 - 13th 2024

[Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) is a widely used Bayesian inference software, which has found many applications across academia and industry, including political science, pharmacometrics, epidemiology, astrophysics, advertising, and more. The conference brings together both veteran and novice users, and serves as a focused event to discuss practical deployment and application of Bayesian modeling.

The main conference is Tuesday 10th - Thursday 12th. 

Monday 9th afternoon we will have a half-day of workshops, including an introductory tutorial on Stan, and we will have an additional day of workshops on Friday 13th. 

The conference comprises one and half day of tutorial (with introductory and advanced courses) and three days of contributed talks.

For any questions, please reach out to stancon2024 at mc-stan dot org.

# [Call for proposals](#call-for-proposals)

We're now accepting proposals for contributed talks and tutorials. Proposals are reviewed by the organization committee on a rolling basis.

Contributed talks are 15 minutes long, with an additional 5 minutes for questions. Talks can cover a diversity of topics, including:
* Data analysis and modeling using Stan in any field
* Software development within Stan or the Stan ecosystem, and more broadly software relevant to Stan users
* Methodological development for Bayesian modeling

To submit a proposal for a talk, please fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSecIfstHZUqdGEyQEaeMNW9gwuM97ofD3iWmFPJnoe11iHEvw/viewform). 

Tutorials are either half-a-day or one day long, with each half-day 2 or 3 hours long. Tutorials should be introductory, though certain pre-requisites may be assumed (e.g. basic knowledge of Stan, R, Python, probability, etc.). When submitting a proposal be specific about the pre-requisites.

We will provide an "introduction to Stan" tutorial, aimed at participants who have not used Stan before.

To submit a proposal for a tutorial, please fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScTJJDpSFArDcrdyD8Hrd_ImnUvYLvmHGc-Ci6Om3AJx5ryzg/viewform).

We also recommend looking into any available rooms at [Oxford Colleges](https://conference-oxford.com//bb-self-catering) or [SpeedyBooker](https://www.speedybooker.com/), many of which offer ensuite accommodation with breakfast in an Oxford Hall and are an idyllic way to experience Oxford.  Please note not all college accommodation is located in central Oxford, not all rooms offer hotel style amenities, and many have shared bathrooms, so please ensure you look for these when booking.

# [Travelling](#travelling)

If you are travelling from within the UK, taking a bus or train directly into Oxford would be the easiest option. Check the national providers for appropriate routes.

If you are travelling from outside the UK, we would suggest first to travel into London via train or plane. If you are travelling via plane, and arriving/departing via Gatwick or Heathrow airport, we recommend booking a return ticket on [the airline](https://www.theairlineoxford.co.uk/) – a bus service that will take you directly from the airport to the central Oxford bus station at Glouster Green. If you are arriving into London via train, and arriving/departing from St Pancras Station, we recommend taking the underground tube to Paddington Station and then a train to Oxford Station. Tickets can be bought at [Great Western Railway](https://www.gwr.com/), [Trainline](https://www.thetrainline.com/en-us), and many other online providers. You can also purchase train tickets at the station if preferred. Travelling via the London underground is easiest using a contactless card. Alternatively, there are regular buses from London and Oxford through the “Oxford Tube” that provide travel at an affordable price.

For further information, please see the university’s advice on [How to get to Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/visitors/visiting-oxford/how-get-oxford) and some advice for [international travel into Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/sites/files/oxford/field/field_document/finding%20your%20way%20to%20Oxford%20guide%202017.pdf), however, please check any travel independently as some information may be outdated.
